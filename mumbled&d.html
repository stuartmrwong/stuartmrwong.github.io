<p><font color="brown">This is under construction <h2>TRIGGER WARNING THIS STORY MAY CONTAIN ELEMENTS THAT ARE DISGUSTING</h2></p>
<p>Our story begins with 3 travelers.  The first is a 14 year old, 135 pound girl named Lavender.  The second is a 3foot tall, 40 pound halfling named Garret.  The third is a anorexic imsoniac 100 pound elf that is somewhat slow named Aust.</p>
<p>The group enters a small town and heads to the tavern.  They sit down at a table and Aust enters a trance where he stares off into space and cannot be communicated with.  The bartender seems offput by the tranced elf and after some potentially rude remarks from Lavender the group gets kicked out of the tavern.</p>
<p>The three friends decide to try and find a job to make some money because they are literally broke.  They enter a shop and Lavender asks if they sell any candy.  The fedora wearing shopkeeper tells the group about how the town's crops have been burned and because of that the town doesn't have much in the way of candy.  Aust uncermoniously pulls out his genitalia.  The shopkeeper tells Aust to stop and Aust pulls his pants back up.  The shopkeep tells the group that his 2/10 pig disgusting wife needs some spider silk from the mines to the west so that she can make some thread.  Aust makes a comment about ejaculation which gets him kicked out of the shop. As they leave Lavender winks at the shopkeep and licks her lips while looking at the wife.</p>
<p>The group contemplates resting but then decides to YOLO it and go to the mines on no sleep. Lavender munches on some hardtack.  Aust asks for some and Lavender declines.  Aust grabs it quickly and throws it on the ground. Lavender pulls out her dagger and Aust runs away.  Aust apologizes from 20 feet away and the group sets off.</p>

<p>As soon as the group enters the western mines they see a GARGANTUAN spider.  It is roughly 10 feet by 10 feet.  The group pulls out their weapons but not before the spider makes a swipe at Aust.  Aust manages to dodge the attack but he shits his pants in the process.  Lavender takes a serious blow but the group manages to take down the spider. Garret has the great idea of using the mines' wheelbarrows to take bag the silk spider sac.  The shopkeep pays each of the adventurers 134 gold each for the spider sac.  Aust heals Lavender back to healthy.</p>

<p>The group loses track of Aust for a second and he wanders off to start aggravating some guards by implying that everything in the world is going great when it obviously isn't for this town.  The guards tell him the world is not currently wonderful and Aust replies with a cocky "It is in my eyes".  This causes the guard to slap Aust which causes him to shit his pants again.  Lavender grabs Aust and tells him to go back to the inn and stop causing trouble.  She talks to the guards and finds out that there are some unholy beasts that are ravaging the kingdom.</p>

<p>The group decides to they need to get back into the tavern keepers good graces if they want a warm bed to sleep in.  Garret is the most polite one of the group so he goes to apologize to the tavern keeper.  While Garret is apologizing Aust and Lavender and waiting outside the tavern in a grassy front yard area.  Aust decides to take off his pants and try to get as much of the shit off of it as possible.  It is mildly effective with the grass brushing it off but it's still disgusting and smells really bad.  Aust puts his pants back on and enters the tavern prematurely.  Lavender grabs him and pulls him back outside to let Garret finish apologizing.  </p>
