Japanese Straightening, Brazilian Blow Out and Keratin Complex

	Japanese Straightening, Brazilian Blow Outs and Keratin Complexes are all hair straightening techniques currently used in the beauty industry.  The desired effect of these three services is to reduce frizz and straighten hair while minimizing damage and promoting healthy looking hair and shine.  There are advantages and disadvantages to each service.  Prices vary widely per service based on location and the salon but the average of these three services is about 300 USD.  These services will never affect hair that will grow in the future; as the client's hair grows the new growth will be unaffected by the service, if the straightened hair is still desired the client will have to go back to the salon and get another service for the new growth.  As with all chemical services, applying this to colored hair, or chemically treated hair risks damage but is usually ok, although a client cannot get a permanent wave treatment on top of a straightening treatment.  Consultations with the client should always be conducted prior to a chemical treatment.
	Japanese Straightening, also called a yuko or thermal reconditioning, started in Japan in 1995 and became internationally popular in the early 2000s.  Much like a permanent wave service, Japanese Straightening uses a solution on the hair that breaks down the bonds in the hair that give it shape.  The hair is then flat ironed to make it straight and a neutralizer is applied to set the style.  The straightened hair will last about 6 months because it actually changes the bonds inside the hair.  After the treatment a client cannot wash their hair or tie it up for 3 days.  The result is extremely straight hair that cannot be curled.  Japanese Straightening can be done on colored hair but it is more difficult and a consultation is required.  This treatment can take up to 8 hours the first time and up to 4 hours for the touch ups on the new growth.
	Brazilian Blowout is a brand.  It uses protein from a blend of amino acids to bond to the hair, it does not alter the chemical bonds inside the hair shaft.  The hair is shampooed and blow dried, then the product is applied.  The hair is then flat ironed with the product still on it then shampooed and the product is rinsed out and conditioned.  This entire process only takes about 90 minutes.  Once the client leaves the salon they can do whatever they want with their hair, the treatment is finished.  They can shampoo or tie their hair up.  This service is fine for clients with color.  The result is easily managed, smooth hair with no frizz, while still maintaining volume, body and bounce.  The result will last between 10-12 weeks.  There are controversies that this product contains formaldehyde, a known carcinogen that over time would be unhealthy for the stylist providing the service.  The company claims that the ingredient is actually methylene glycol and that modern testing cannot tell the difference between methylene glycol and formaldehyde.  Regardless, they have released a new product called Brazilian Blowout Zero that contains no methylene glycol or formaldehyde.  However there is skepticism on the results that the new Zero product can provide without the use of methylene glycol and formaldehyde.  Canada and the European Union have banned this service.
	Keratin Complex is a brand.  It is similar to a Brazilian Blowout. It is a treatment that uses a protein called keratin to strengthen the hair shaft and is beneficial for a client's hair.  However the treatment also contains formaldehyde.  Both the formaldehyde and the keratin are necessary for the treatment to be successful.  This treatment infuses keratin into the hair shaft, it does not break down the bonds in the hair that determine shape, thus it will eventually wash out of hair or wear out in about 4 months.  Keratin complex removes frizz and smoothes hair.  In this treatment hair is shampooed then dried.  After the hair is dried the Keratin Complex product is applied to the hair and combed through.  The hair is left to process under a plastic cap.  Finally, the hair is rinsed, dried, and smoothed with a flat iron which seals the keratin into the cuticle of the hair. The client leaves the salon with the product still in their hair, they are asked to either wash it out after three days or to return to the salon.  The result is straightened hair that can still have some wave, body or curl.  After the treatment a client cannot wash their hair or tie it up for 3 days.  Theoretically the proper after care would be to use a keratin shampoo and conditioner.  These treatments usually take 2-3 hours or longer depending on the length of the client's hair.
	Keratin Complex is the worst of these services.  It is unhealthy and the client has to keep the product in their hair for 3 days after the service during which time they cannot crease it or do anything that would leave a dent in their hair.  This is too much to ask of a client.  Japanese Straightening is the best of these services.  It straightens the hair the most because it actually restructures the bonds inside the hair shaft.  It lasts the longest amount of time and looks the best.
