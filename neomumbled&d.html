<h1>Session 1. February 14, 2016</h1>
<p>Our story begins with 3 travelers.  The first is a 14 year old, 102 pound girl named Rosemary.  The second is a 4 foot tall 12 year old boy named Rand Smith.  The third is a 6 foot 6 giant robot that weighs 300 pounds and is powered by magic named S.R.C.H.E #0451.  The three travelers arrive at the city of Ri Baile in the kingdom of Pobail Munitir.  It is a human capital city.  The party overhears that apparently the king has raised taxes and yet has not been providing any extra services to the people.  In fact, it seems that even less services are being provided and bandits and thieves are running wild.  Many farmers outside of town have been robbed and even traveling merchants.  The group decides to head into the forest but S.R.C.H.E wont move. Rosemary smacks him and giggles.  S.R.C.H.E screams and they head out to see if they can find these bandits and bring them to justice.  S.R.C.H.E has historical knowledge about the area and knows that this path is ripe with criminals looking for travelers to rob. Almost immediately they sense that there are some people hiding themselves nearby.  Rosemary jumps and hides in a bush. They are accosted by three bandits demanding a toll to travel along the road.  After some failed intimidation tactics Rand shoots the toll taker in the chest with his crossbow.  S.R.C.H.E splits him in half vertically with his greatsword. One of the bandits gets a lucky hit on S.R.C.H.E.  Rosemary rushes to his defense and stabs the bandit with her rapier. Rand shoots him with his crossbow and all the bandits are dead. Rand makes sure they are all dead and carefully dismembers one of their heads to take back to town.  The group heads back into town and presents the head to the preaching man.  The preachers asks how they could know that this is the bandit that is terrorizing the town. Rand throws the head and one of the bandit cloaks into the air, and shoots a crossbow bolt through both of them, pinning it to the wall.  The group decides to take a rest in the tavern and try to figure out if there is perhaps a ringleader or organization behind the wheat raids.</p>
