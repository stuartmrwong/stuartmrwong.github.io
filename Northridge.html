<h1>Session 1. January 1st, 2019</h1>

<p>Our adventure begins with Varis Nailo, an elven drow wizard. He spent the majority of his life studying at a magical academy with others to try and unravel the mysteries of the universe and organize and acquire knowledge. Varis’ studies led him down a dark path which he realized a colleague named Trannum Meadowleaf was already on. Although they did not study together, they mutually shared information about a dark and taboo subject, the undead and immortality. During this time is when Varis’ devotion to the Chemosh, the god of the undead. The elders of the academy eventually caught on to Varis’ studies and banished him, fortunately or unfortunately Trannum mysteriously disappeared and was never found out.  </p>
<p>Despite this, Varis’ desire for knowledge particularly related to the undead and possibilities of immortality led him to travel from town to town, meandering through his years and leading a partially nomadic life, never staying in one place too long for fear of becoming complacent. Most people were relieved to see him leave, the drow were not looked favorably upon. Spurred on by a note written to him by Trannum telling him to go to the scavenger city of Northridge, for there was a tomb there with important significance to their mutual study.</p>
<p>Varis arrives at the small city of Northridge. It is located on the edge of a large ridge that drops to a valley hundreds of feet below. This city is known for the extremely indecent and rude people. They are filthy scum in the eyes of most. A powerful mage guild and thieves guild operates out of this dumpy city. As he walks to the center of the bustling town he passes a middle-class residential area and a library dedicated to the religious study of Morgion and his ideals.</p>
<p>Varis decides to head to the library first. As he walks over there he sees 2 men in robes, presumably from the mage guild and 2 men in leather armor, presumably from the thieves guild. The two groups of people are arguing with each other and it starts to get heated. Varis looks around and realizes most of the people in this town are dressed like one of the two parties and everyone around him are starting to shift, move into strategically advantageous positions and some even stealthily pull daggers from their hips and clutch them by their sides. One gentleman in particular slowly lifts his scarf up to cover his grin and lowers his hat to cover his eyes. He twirled his dagger on his fingertip and seems excited to spill blood. Some mages with robes start to head around corners or position themselves behind cover. Shopkeepers start to walk outside to see what is going on and some start to close their doors.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Varis casually hitches his donkey at the library to a makeshift post made of broken crates. He looks around for a building with multiple floors and sees a fruit and vegetable shop with what looks like housing on the second floor. He walks in while the shopkeeper is busy looking at the commotion and steals 3 carrots. Varis approaches the shopkeep with some silver pieces and convinces him to direct Varis to a ladder in the back of the shop, adjacent to the stairs. After climbing the ladder Varis peers over the edge and sees that the commotion has grown to 4 mages arguing with 6 leather-clad men, with many other individuals looking on and positioned around them. Varis pulls a pouch from his bag and takes a pinch of powdered white phosphorus, he whispers a few words into them then gently blows it in the direction of the altercation.  Suddenly 4 orbs emitting a brilliant light appeared in front of the mages. Three of the leather-clad men arguing with them saw this as provocation and immediately, as if cued, drew their daggers, stepped forward and stabbed a mage each in the chest.  Commoners started fleeing in every direction while the prepared bystanders starting stabbing other people around them, men in robes all over started shooting fire, ice and lightning at them. Everything was cloudy with smoke and loud with the cries of stabbed or scorched victims.</p>
<p>Varis took this opportunity to leave the shop and walk to the library but immediately upon exiting the shop a man in leather with his shoulder scorched and bloody, saw Varis and lunged at him with a knife. Varis side stepped the attack and quickly grabbed the hand crossbow at his hip and shot the man in the abdomen. The man, now bleeding profusely started to stumble away. Varis took his time and shot him again, this time in the back. The man crumpled to the ground, blood dripping from his wounds, his good arm collapsing under his weight, crawling and dragging his body away. Varis gave him a pitiful look and continued his walk to the library.</p>
