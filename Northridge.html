<h1>Session 1. January 1st, 2019</h1>

<p>Our adventure begins with Varis Nailo, an elven drow wizard. He spent the majority of his life studying at a magical academy with others to try and unravel the mysteries of the universe and organize and acquire knowledge. Varis’ studies led him down a dark path which he realized a colleague named Trannum Meadowleaf was already on. Although they did not study together, they mutually shared information about a dark and taboo subject, the undead and immortality. During this time is when Varis’ devotion to the Chemosh, the god of the undead. The elders of the academy eventually caught on to Varis’ studies and banished him, fortunately or unfortunately Trannum mysteriously disappeared and was never found out.  </p>
  
<p>Despite this, Varis’ desire for knowledge particularly related to the undead and possibilities of immortality led him to travel from town to town, meandering through his years and leading a partially nomadic life, never staying in one place too long for fear of becoming complacent. Most people were relieved to see him leave, the drow were not looked favorably upon. Varis continued his journey, spurred on by a note written to him by Trannum telling him to go to the scavenger city of Northridge, for there was a tomb there with important significance to their mutual study.</p>
  
<p>Varis arrives at the small city of Northridge. It is located on the edge of a large ridge that drops to a valley hundreds of feet below. This city is known for it's extremely indecent and rude people. They are filthy scum in the eyes of most. A powerful mage guild and thieves guild operates out of this dumpy city. As he walks to the center of the bustling town he passes a middle-class residential area and a library dedicated to the religious study of Morgion and his ideals.</p>
  
<p>Varis decides to head to the library first. As he walks over there he sees 2 men in robes, presumably from the mage guild and 2 men in leather armor, presumably from the thieves guild. The two groups of people are arguing with each other and it starts to get heated. Varis looks around and realizes most of the people in this town are dressed like one of the two parties and everyone around him are starting to shift, move into strategically advantageous positions and some even stealthily pull daggers from their hips and clutch them by their sides. One gentleman in particular slowly lifts his scarf up to cover his grin and lowers his hat to cover his eyes. He twirled his dagger on his fingertip and seems excited to spill blood. Some mages with robes start to head around corners or position themselves behind cover. Shopkeepers start to walk outside to see what is going on and some start to close their doors.</p>
  
<p>Seeing this, Varis casually hitches his donkey at the library to a makeshift post made of broken crates. He looks around for a building with multiple floors and sees a fruit and vegetable shop with what looks like housing on the second floor. He walks in while the shopkeeper is busy looking at the commotion and steals 3 carrots. Varis approaches the shopkeep with some silver pieces and convinces him to direct Varis to a ladder in the back of the shop, adjacent to the stairs. After climbing the ladder Varis peers over the edge and sees that the commotion has grown to 4 mages arguing with 6 leather-clad men, with many other individuals looking on and positioned around them. Varis pulls a pouch from his bag and takes a pinch of powdered white phosphorus, he whispers a few words into them then gently blows it in the direction of the altercation.  Suddenly 4 orbs emitting a brilliant light appeared in front of the mages. Three of the leather-clad men arguing with them saw this as provocation and immediately, as if cued, drew their daggers, stepped forward and stabbed a mage each in the chest.  Commoners started fleeing in every direction while the prepared bystanders starting stabbing other people around them, men in robes all over started shooting fire, ice and lightning at them. Everything was cloudy with smoke and loud with the cries of stabbed or scorched victims.</p>
  
<p>Varis took this opportunity to leave the shop and walk to the library but immediately upon exiting the shop a man in leather with his shoulder scorched and bloody, saw Varis and lunged at him with a knife. Varis side stepped the attack and quickly grabbed the hand crossbow at his hip and shot the man in the abdomen. The man, now bleeding profusely started to stumble away. Varis took his time and shot him again, this time in the back. The man crumpled to the ground, blood dripping from his wounds, his good arm collapsing under his weight, crawling and dragging his body away. Varis gave him a pitiful look and continued his walk to the library.</p>  
  
<p>Varis arrives at the library and as he enters he can see plants in various states of decay line the walls, its dimly lit and a fine mist of dust is visible in the striking sun beams that shine through glass windows that have been painted over with a black ink in an attempt to keep out the light. There aren’t many people here, save for one or two librarians that seem to be organizing various texts. There are many rows of books and tables set up to study with candles to provide extra light.</p>
  
<p>Varis walks through the aisles, perusing the book spines until he runs into one of the librarians. He asks to which one of these books is the best. The librarian looks at him and cocks his head, but after a moment suggests a textbook called "The various stages of decomposition of the body after death". Varis grabs the book and sits down at a desk with a candle lit, he opens up the book and skips through most of the chapters because its common knowledge to him. But as he gets near the end of the book it begins to become less scientific and much more theoretical. The last chapter is titled "Death and Restoration". It describes various theories about how one could potentially either bring a corpse back to life or possibly reanimate something deceased. The most fleshed out theory pertains to phylacteries and the storing of a soul outside of the body to be used after the host's original body has been destroyed or is no longer functional. Varis decides he is finished with the book for now and decides to speak to the only other patron in the library regarding the contents. The man says that Varis should be spending more time studying the decay of all things, matter, idealogies, governments, and nations and less time on what happens to corpses.</p>
  
<p>Varis exits the library and looks around for a tavern. He ends up at The Golden Spider, a tavern and inn on the first floor and a brothel on the second. He pays for his donkey to spend the night in the barn and sits at the bar where the barmaid owner comes to take his order. Varis asks for a rootbeer from the strikingly attractive woman which he drinks while eating a carrot. He also ends up purchasing and eating some cucumbers. A drunken man stumbles into Varis and drops 2 silver. Varis picks up the 2 silver, and orders a mug of ale. He then walks over to the drunken man, shows him the ale, drops the 2 silver coins into the mug and then slams the mug into the man's face. The drunken man angrily swings at Varis and hits him hard in the eye. 3 men immediately rush over to break up the fight. Varis retreats to his room where he cuts up the bedsheet to bandage his eye and goes into a trance for 4 hours.</p>
  
<h1>Session 2. January 4th, 2019</h1>
  
<p>"Aww what a good's night rest!" Varis exclaims as he wakes up at about 2am. He checks out the hallway and goes out the back entrance and looks at surveys the barn area where his donkey is sleeping. He can hear people eating and drinking in the bar area. Varis checks the other rooms on the first floor of the inn but they are all locked.</p>
  
<p>Varis approaches the bar and speaks to a young boy and purchases a loaf of bread, a hunk of cheese and a mug of ale. Varis goes and sits across from the only other patron in the bar. She is eating her own food, while Varis tries to secretly put a cucumber on the bench next to him. Varis is terrible at doing this secretly and the woman sees everything. She starts to chew slowly and swallow and doesn't take any more bites. She looks at the cucumber and looks at Varis inquisitively. Varis takes out another cucumber to eat with his bread and cheese. Varis starts to scoop out the center of the loaf onto the floor and asks "What keeps you up so late?" She responds "long night". The woman briefly wonders if he is going to put the cucumber into the loaf but varis puts the cheese into it. They eat in silence. Varis stumbles to try and make conversation and the woman looks perturbed and takes her food and leaves.</p>
  
<p>Varis exits the inn in the very early morning and heads to the town circle. He sees 2 robes arguing with 2 leathers. Varis sneaks up to listen to them and realizes they are talking about how the conflicts between their factions need to end and riots like the one yesterday need to cease. Varis slowly and carefully pulls his hand crossbow from his waist and takes aim at one of the robes. He fires a shot that grazes his arm, blood starts to discolor his robes. Before anyone has any time to react Varis fires a ray of sickly green energy at the other robe. It instantly makes contact and begins to decay the flesh upon contact, the robe starts to convulse and vomit spits in all directions, the robe collapses while his skin scabs and splits, slicking his robes with his blood. The 2 leathers immediately ascertain Varis' position but the first robe just howls in terror at watching the body of his friend decompose. Varis fires off another ray of the green energy at the other robe but trips during the casting and misses. The robe keeps screaming as his friend bubbles and a rotting smell of flesh and compost fills the air. One leather runs at Varis and slashes him with his dagger, tearing through Varis' robes and bloodying him, the other leather runs away. Varis summons a ghostly skeletal hand that goes to grasp at the leather, who nimbly sidesteps it. The robe shoots a blash of fire at Varis but hits the barrel that Varis was originally hiding behind, adjusting he fires another that hits grazes Varis and hits the barrel. Varis conjures up the translucent skeletal hand again and it claws through the leather's face in a downward angle. As each finger makes contact, the flesh of his face begins to pus and boil, turning greenish then black, the hand continues completely through and the man falls to the ground dead. The robe shoots a third blast of fire at Varis and hits him square in the chest. Varis's robes are cut up, bloody and now scorched, he is bleeding and in pain. He knows there is only one way out of this situation, the last robe needs to die. The skeletal dismembered hand appears once more and closes around the robes' throat, decaying the flesh until his head just slides off. Varis hurriedly takes the guild insignias, a set of intertwining circles, and stars upon stars, and a piece of paper from the leather and the robe and returns to The Golden Spider.</p>
  
<p>Back at the inn, Varis reads the paper, it is directions to a gambling den with a secret area, apparently this leather was supposed to go there and help out with something. Varis trances in his room for 4 hours then heads to the bar and orders a mug of ale and some of the hearty meat stew. It tastes awful, absolutely terrible. Varis calls Elsha over and before he can say anything she says "You want some root beer with that huh?". Varis considers starting something but leaves instead and goes to grab his donkey from the barnkeeper. Varis tips the man and rides toward the town circle.  Before he can get into the center of town, Varis sees all the wagon shops have set up along the road today instead of the circle. As he approaches the circle he sees 6 guards that have blocked the road to conduct an investigation on 3 decayed, rotting corpses. </p>
  
<p>Varis approaches one of the wagons, it is run by a young man who tailors clothing. After some chatter Varis learns the man is named Kayne and he has never met a drow before. Varis agrees to buy a tailored set of red robes from the young man who will have it ready by sundown. Varis proceeds to find the best looking vegetable stand. A little girl is running it and Varis, being an expert at social interaction with children, asks her to guess his age. She guesses 1000 and he entertains her. He continues to speak but she doesn't seem to understand what he means. She explains that they normally sell their food in a different town called Arienford but because of goblins they have to go here instead. She mentions that when they go to Arienford they are the only vegetable sellers but here in Northridge there are lots and her parents dont like that. Varis says that he completely understands why her parents might have a problem with competition. Varis asks her what her favorite vegetable is and she says cauliflower. Varis says his least favorite is eggplant because it reminds him of the color of his skin. The girl is super nice and Varis gets a crazy deal on 2 heads of cauliflower. He pays for it but then gives the girl a gold piece just for her. She is surprised and asks Varis his name and introduces herself as Ula.</p>
  
<p>Varis goes to another stand and speaks to an old lady and asks for directions to Arienford. Varis asks for something more interesting and the old lady says "I have just what you are looking for" and produces a pipe filled with a crushed blue flower, she mentions that if he needs more he can come back to her or ask one of the leathers. Varis purchases it.</p>
  
<p>Varis heads into the mage district where he passes by various spell component shops selling everything from powdered phosphorus, to pinches of dust and insect parts until he finds what he is looking for.  He enters a clother and purchases a set of the same grey robes that all of the lower tier robes wear. It is slightly too big for his skinny frame. He visits the mage guild and is prevented entry by 2 men in white and blue robes who tell him the next examination period for admission is in 3 months.</p>
  
<p>Varis returns to the bar and sees a leather sitting at the bar talking with Elsha. "It's not worth it, I'm not going to Arienford tomorrow Elsha. There are goblins and for what we are doing it just isn't worth it." "Well I'm going, I'll find someone else if you back out." With that, the man leaves and Varis takes his place at the bar. Elsha says that she doesn't appreciate what Varis did last night and brings him his ale. Varis reads over the paper he got from the leather once more and sees Elsha hurry over and apologize for the terrible food earlier. Varis says they are even for what he did last night. </p>
  
<p>They get to talking and Elsha mentions that he didn't look so good with his fists in that fight. "I didn't want to pull out my weapons". "What weapons?" Varis puts his dagger and crossbow on the counter. "Do you see a lot of combat with those?" "Yes". "Are you looking for work?" "Depends on what work." "Well I need to go to Arienford, but there are bandits on the road and then there's that whole goblin problem. You wanna play hero and save Arienford?" "When do you leave?" "Tomorrow morning, and I'm kidding about the hero part, that town can burn. I just need to get there." Varis says "Good, that will be cheaper." Elsha smirks at him, "You in?" Varis states that he needs some time to think and that she will have her answer by tomorrow morning. He begins to eat his cauliflower and a cucumber.</p>
  
<p>Varis returns to the town circle and speaks to one of the guards that is currently herding pedestrians around the investigation crime scene.  The guard mentions that he has never seen bodies like this before, it has to have been magic. The guard surmises that it must have been the crazy mages at the mages guild because he has heard they are sick and twisted, just as twisted and untrustworthy as those leathers. Varis decides to find a bench by the large inoperable fountain and trances for 4 hours. Ula looks at the drow elf while he is in his meditative state then goes back to selling cauliflowers and other vegetables. While in his elven trance he ponders how maybe he should feel something about his deeds but he doesn't. He has no regrets about the lives he has taken. Varis' realization frightens him. He notes that recently he has done more evil deeds and he doesn't know why. He thinks about Trannum and clutches his colleagues last letter to him. He thinks about how his human friends all die before him and elves can't stand the sight of him, how terribly alone he is.</p>
  
<p>When he wakes the investigation is over and Varis goes to the old lady and buys another packet of the crushed blue flowers and a new pipe. Varis goes and gets his new robes from Kayne and mentions that he is a monster bounty hunter.  Kayne says that if Varis' robes ever get torn up again he knows who to come to. "A monster bounty hunter huh? Are you headed to Arienford then? I heard you can exchange goblin scalps for coin." </p>
  
<p>Varis decides to go out of the town on the promise that the guards at the main gate will let him back in. He decides to sneak his way through the forest toward arienford for 2 hours. Nothing happens and he decides to head back. Shortly after he sees 2 goblins squawking at each other. They seem to be scout goblins. When one branches off from the other Varis decides to create necromantic life and attach it to his life force. Then he sneaks up behind the goblin and stabs him in the back with his dagger, as the goblin screams into the night Varis forces the ephemeral skeletal hand into the back of the goblin and through it's abdomen, withering the soul and decaying the flesh into nothing. The other goblin scurries over and swings its scimitar but hits the tree next to Varis. Varis fires off a ray of green energy that the goblin dodges that slashes Varis across the chest. Varis fires off a quick shot with his hand crossbow that sticks in the goblin's chest. The goblin begins to flail and Varis takes his dagger and slams it into it's throat. He checks their belongings then begins to scalp the two goblins. It is a messy process and blood is everywhere.</p>
  
<p>As Varis returns to the town, the guards seem worried about the proximity of these goblin scouts. "Just getting a head start, leaving town tomorrow." The guards tell Varis that in the future he can just bring back goblin ears, he doesn't have to scalp them. "Oh these scalps? Not for sale." The guards look at varis in shock as he rides past on his donkey. "What the fuck..."  The barnkeeper at the Inn sees Varis approach, a thin white haired drow with glowing red eyes holding two bloody goblin scalps. The barnkeep doesn't ask for payment, he quickly grabs the donkey reins and tries to lead the donkey to the barn as fast as he can. The donkey doesn't seem to be in a hurry though so the barnkeeper is actively fighting with donkey while intentionally not looking back. Varis follows the man because he intends to enter The Golden Spider through the rear entrance. The barnkeeper begins to shake as he realizes Varis is walking behind him.</p>
  
<p>Varis holds the scalps behind his back and checks around the corner to see who is working the bar. Elsha is working the bar so Varis goes to the bar and sits down. Varis orders an ale. "I've thought about it, and I'll be ready in the morning." and Varis puts the 2 goblin scalps on the counter. Elsha smiles and pours her own glass of ale "Tomorrow morning then, I'll cheers to that." The two clink their glasses.</p>
