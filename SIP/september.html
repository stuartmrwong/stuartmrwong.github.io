 <h3>September 1st, 2020. Day 167.<h3>  
    <p>I woke up at 4:30am and tossed and turned until 6am. I got my coffee and started studying. I finished reading a chapter and taking notes and posting to canvas at about 10:30am. My brain is fried now. I need a break. Ok what else do I need to do this week for class? I need to do my 1.5.7 network representation lab, then assignements 1.3-1.6. For my net sec class I need to read chapter 3 and take notes. My unix class will release homework tomorrow. I also need to get gas for the volvo and break down cardboard boxes. Volvo passed smog today and I carried another 6 yards of soil to the backyard. Ok that counts as a break, time for that lab! I reread my August journal and some parts were very technical, and I think not everyone cares to read that so just know you can skip over whatever you want, this isn't one of those museum plaques that you have to read in it's entirety or feel like you are missing out hehe. The lab took me about 45 minutes. Studied ICS and did a quiz for it. Then I talked to my girlfriend on the phone and we watched cookie decorating videos together! It looks so fun! I kind of want to get a kit and pipe some flowers!

 <h3>September 2nd, 2020. Day 168.<h3> 
   <p>I don't want to get political on here so I'm not going to say any names but yesterday a big name politican got their hair done in San Francisco. It was indoors and they didn't wear a mask. If you look at time stamps they appeared on MSNBC after the appointment and their hair looked perfect. There is one report that says they only got a blowdry but it hasn't been confirmed and therefore holds no weight. It is certainly possible they got a cut and color as well, in fact, they have colored hair, base and highlights, and none of their roots are showing in that MSNBC appearance. I could understand doing your own base color at home but not highlights that have to be done in foils. Honestly if you live in San Francisco and your lightened hair doesn't have a line of demarcation at least 3 inches off your scalp then you got color done either illegally in SF or you drove to a different county for a non-essential service which is also illegal. The reason I am writing about this so much is because I am a hair dresser and it's been 168 days since I worked. Yesterday London allowed salons to open for outdoor services only and I feel this politician would know that. Indoor services of any kind are not allowed. Masks are required, as well as questionnaires about your contact with other people and temperatures screenings. Every salon and barbershop I know of has stated they cannot work outside, either because the integrity of the service is compromised or because salons don't have outdoor spaces, are we supposed to block the sidewalk or parking spaces like the restaurants do? It especially sucks because I know that if this big name politician approached me and said do my hair indoors and I will pay you, I would have said yes with no hesitation. I want to work, I enjoy doing hair, and doing a big name like this would be pretty cool. It just feels like I see the media and all the politicians have nice hair, meanwhile all my neighbors don't and my coworkers in the industry are suffering.

   <p>I did a whole bunch of studying today and got gas for the car. Then I had a meeting with sf living wage and I helped troubleshoot their NAS! I got the internship there but it is more sys admin than it is penetration but that's ok because no one had penetration internships. Lots more studying then I talked to my girlfriend on the phone a little bit.

   <p>Today I am going over to my girlfriends place. We are going to get bulgogi for lunch and then play dnd at night. It was really fun, the story is doing my arc now so I got a magical sword and beat up my bully of a brother. We learned more about my backstory too!
