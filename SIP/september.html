 <h3>September 1st, 2020. Day 167.<h3>  
    <p>I woke up at 4:30am and tossed and turned until 6am. I got my coffee and started studying. I finished reading a chapter and taking notes and posting to canvas at about 10:30am. My brain is fried now. I need a break. Ok what else do I need to do this week for class? I need to do my 1.5.7 network representation lab, then assignements 1.3-1.6. For my net sec class I need to read chapter 3 and take notes. My unix class will release homework tomorrow. I also need to get gas for the volvo and break down cardboard boxes. Volvo passed smog today and I carried another 6 yards of soil to the backyard. Ok that counts as a break, time for that lab! I reread my August journal and some parts were very technical, and I think not everyone cares to read that so just know you can skip over whatever you want, this isn't one of those museum plaques that you have to read in it's entirety or feel like you are missing out hehe.
