 <h3>September 1st, 2020. Day 167.<h3>  
    <p>I woke up at 4:30am and tossed and turned until 6am. I got my coffee and started studying. I finished reading a chapter and taking notes and posting to canvas at about 10:30am. My brain is fried now. I need a break. Ok what else do I need to do this week for class? I need to do my 1.5.7 network representation lab, then assignements 1.3-1.6. For my net sec class I need to read chapter 3 and take notes. My unix class will release homework tomorrow. I also need to get gas for the volvo and break down cardboard boxes. Volvo passed smog today and I carried another 6 yards of soil to the backyard. Ok that counts as a break, time for that lab! I reread my August journal and some parts were very technical, and I think not everyone cares to read that so just know you can skip over whatever you want, this isn't one of those museum plaques that you have to read in it's entirety or feel like you are missing out hehe. The lab took me about 45 minutes. Studied ICS and did a quiz for it. Then I talked to my girlfriend on the phone and we watched cookie decorating videos together! It looks so fun! I kind of want to get a kit and pipe some flowers!

 <h3>September 2nd, 2020. Day 168.<h3> 
   <p>I don't want to get political on here so I'm not going to say any names but yesterday a big name politican got their hair done in San Francisco. It was indoors and they didn't wear a mask. If you look at time stamps they appeared on MSNBC after the appointment and their hair looked perfect. There is one report that says they only got a blowdry but it hasn't been confirmed and therefore holds no weight. It is certainly possible they got a cut and color as well, in fact, they have colored hair, base and highlights, and none of their roots are showing in that MSNBC appearance. I could understand doing your own base color at home but not highlights that have to be done in foils. Honestly if you live in San Francisco and your lightened hair doesn't have a line of demarcation at least 3 inches off your scalp then you got color done either illegally in SF or you drove to a different county for a non-essential service which is also illegal. The reason I am writing about this so much is because I am a hair dresser and it's been 168 days since I worked. Yesterday London allowed salons to open for outdoor services only and I feel this politician would know that. Indoor services of any kind are not allowed. Masks are required, as well as questionnaires about your contact with other people and temperatures screenings. Every salon and barbershop I know of has stated they cannot work outside, either because the integrity of the service is compromised or because salons don't have outdoor spaces, are we supposed to block the sidewalk or parking spaces like the restaurants do? It especially sucks because I know that if this big name politician approached me and said do my hair indoors and I will pay you, I would have said yes with no hesitation. I want to work, I enjoy doing hair, and doing a big name like this would be pretty cool. It just feels like I see the media and all the politicians have nice hair, meanwhile all my neighbors don't and my coworkers in the industry are suffering. 
   </p>
   <p>I did a whole bunch of studying today and got gas for the car. Then I had a meeting with sf living wage and I helped troubleshoot their NAS! I got the internship there but it is more sys admin than it is penetration but that's ok because no one had penetration internships. Lots more studying then I talked to my girlfriend on the phone a little bit.
   </p>
 <h3>September 3rd, 2020. Day 169.<h3> 
   <p>Lots of studying, mainly reading and taking notes today. Did a room on THM. Studied some more. Played a video game. I have all my homework done now. Gonna practice with my CPTC team tonight. We did a box called Ice. It went well and I learned a lot.
   </p>
 <h3>September 4th, 2020. Day 170.<h3> 
   <p>Today I am going over to my girlfriends place. We are going to get bulgogi for lunch and then play dnd at night. It was really fun, the story is doing my arc now so I got a magical sword and beat up my bully of a brother. We learned more about my backstory too!
   </p>
<h3>September 5th, 2020. Day 171.<h3> 
  <p>Studying while side by side with my girlfriend on her sofa. I studied OWASP ZAP, nikto, and some networking stuff. She studied in MATLAB the whole day and I studied in my kali box the whole day. I took a break to go pick up lunch for us and to browse reddit. It was really hot today. Like not the hottest it has ever been but really very hot. 95 I think. Then in the evening we played dungeons and dragons and drank cold beverages.
  </p>
<h3>September 6th, 2020. Day 172.<h3> 
  <p>Today I woke up and cut my girlfriend's hair on her balcony. Then we watched church then communion and fellowship. Then panera bread and starbucks. Then her washing machine broke so we took all her dirty clothes (that weren't locked in her broken washing machine) to my place and did 3 loads of laundry. During this time we watched drunk history, brooklyn 99, and went to petsmart to pickup a bio-degradable litter box for her cat Mullen who was also at my house. He was very curious and had a fun time exploring I think. Then I talked to her on the phone on her drive back.
  </p>
<h3>September 7th, 2020. Day 173.<h3>  
  <p>Today is labor day. I did a box that half my team did yesterday. Then I had class at 11am to noon. Why do people always wait at the beginning of zoom calls? It has a set time that everyone knows, there is no reason to "wait 5 minutes to let people join" they should have been connected 5 minutes before the meeting started! Then because people know it really starts at 11:05 they joing at 11:05 in the future, further exacerbating the problem! Then I studied some more and played dominion with my family. Wow it is hot today. My studies go slower when it is hot, this has become obvious. I played gloomhaven at 4:30 with some friends then attended a family zoom meeting at 8pm. I didn't want to open the windows because of the smoke from the fires but it is just so hot my computer crashed. I have been gulping down ice water all day and have a wet towel on me with a fan.
  </p>
<h3>September 8th, 2020. Day 174.<h3>  
  <p>Today I am watching my girlfriend's cat. It is too hot where she lives and she goes into the office for work so the cat would be alone in 100+ degrees. So instead he is here with me! He is well-behaved and just chilling on my bed right now. I did a bunch of studying this morning and intend to maybe take a nap if it gets super hot. It is only supposed to get to 79 today though so maybe it won't be that bad. More studying, specifically SQLi, sqlmap, JTR. Mullen the cat hung out on my bed and I had a bowl of water and another with food in my room which he would periodically nibble on. When I left my room to go to the bathroom I would leave my door open, if he came out then I would assume he wanted to use the litter box so I would follow him downstairs. But usually he would just chill on my bed hehe. In the evening my girlfriend came to pick him up and we went for a walk for 2 miles.
  </p>
<h3>September 9th, 2020. Day 175.<h3>  
  <p>Today the sky is red and everything has a orange tint. I mean really red and really orange. You can look up photos online. It is so dark that I have all my lights in my room turned on so I can read my textbook. Normally I just have the blinds open for light. Today I am going to study a bunch. Then at 4pm I have a zoom call with sf living wage as part of my internship and then at 6pm another zoom call with ccsf about internships. I am studying powershell and then active directory. Wow powershell is annoying, everything is verb-noun and bash is just better. Just finished the zoom call with sf living wage. We got the NAS up and running for a daily (incremental) backup and a weekly full backup. We used buffalo terastation. Ok so the apprenticeship zoom meeting was very informative. Basically I need to finish my 4 classes this semester and then I can apply. If I don't get in at that time then I can take another 4 required classes and then apply after that.

<h3>September 10th, 2020. Day 176.<h3>  
  <p>The air is not good today. It is 168 on airnow. I had to reformat my PC but honestly it was time to do so. So I've got a fresh install of Windows 10. I use ninite whenever I reformat and so I quickly was up and running. I would say the entire process took less than 2.5 hours. Studying about content management systems on web servers today. Tonight I'm going to practice with my CPTC team. Practice went really well. Learned about kerberos ticketing in active directory. My intro to UNIX teacher messaged me and said he couldn't read my homework. But my homework was literally the body of an email. There shouldn't be any way that he can't read that. I resent the homework as a .txt file attachment. I hope he doesn't mark me late but I have a feeling he will... This is stressful and frustrating because I feel like if this class was physical it might have been more clear that he needs it as a .txt attachment.  Later I played some among us with my friends, it is basically like mafia. Then I talked with my girlfriend on the phone!
  </p>
<h3>September 11th, 2020. Day 177.<h3>  
  <p>On Monday salons will re-open indoors. The 14th of September. I think that means this journal ends there. Right? Anyways I studied a bunch of active directory today. Talked to my friend on the phone. Then played dnd with my Friday friends! Oh I also moved a ton of soil to the backyard and arranged it to begin dumping it into these brick planters. Oh also today I played one match of counter strike with friends. Over my lifetime I have played over 1500 hours easily. And yet I have been studying and not playing for months and I literally got 1 kill the entire match. I am terrible now. The end of an era.
  </p>
<h3>September 12th, 2020. Day 178.<h3>
  <p>The air is still bad today. I made spam fried rice for breakfast. I studied some bash. I am going to my girlfriend's place tonight and will attempt to fix her washing machine. When I say 'fix' I just mean try to make it so the door opens, currently it is locked and won't open. We played a boardgame called Elder Sign, it was pretty fun!
  </p>
<h3>September 13th, 2020. Day 179.<h3>
  <p>I spent the morning with my girlfriend trying to fix the washing machine but we couldn't do it. Sucks. Then we attended church online. I went back home and studied then studied with my CPTC team. We did a box on HTB called remote. We got user and root. I learned lots of new things, especially about windows.
