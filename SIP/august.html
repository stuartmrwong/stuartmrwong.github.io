 <h3>August 1st, 2020. Day 137.<h3>  
    <p>I ran errands in the morning again. My father picked up that car from the shop. It looks really nice, new headlights, new paint, new door, lots of little things fixed. My cousin owned the car before and she pissed some guy off in a parking lot so he keyed the car and kicked dents into it lol. I made an espresso for myself. My girlfriend is preparing a two-shot dnd game where we are all going to have max level characters so I need to flesh out my character today. I think I am going to basically make a ninja from naruto and run around doing jutsus. Now the question is which village should I be from and what chakra nature? 
    </p>
 <h3>August 2nd, 2020. Day 138.<h3> 
    <p>Church with my girlfriend and coffee. Later I gathered up all the garbage, recycling and compost and watered the plants. I went to lunch with my father. I played GTA Online then I headed to my girlfriends place. We got bubble tea, I got lychee jelly, that's my favorite. Then we watched an episode of Brooklyn 99.
    </p>
 <h3>August 3rd, 2020. Day 139.<h3> 
 <p>SBUX drivethrough with my girlfriend. I spent the morning installing BIND on my windows laptop. You can download 32 bit or 64 bit from ISC. It will be a zip. Unzip it and run the BINDInstall.exe, you need to run it as administrator. Enter a username and a password. Leave the checkboxes alone. After this you will need to go into control panel>system>advanced>system properties>path>edit> and add your installation folder ISC BIND9/bin as a path. Then open command prompt and you can type dig and it should work. Welcome to the groper.
 </p>
 <h3>August 4th, 2020. Day 140.<h3>
   <p>Today I drove my girlfriend to her office (where there are no other people because everyone works from home, but she gets more work done in the office environment) and I picked her up afterwords. I brought her favorite sushi rolls and then we played dnd. I also had a 94 minute long zoom meeting at noon with the person in charge of the internship I am trying to get at CCSF. It must have gone well because no one has a bad meeting for 94 minutes right? Anyways he said I need to learn to hack so I can do penetration testing. So I need to learn linux and powershell like ASAP. Last semester there were 30 candidates (people who got through all the classes and passed) for the internship. The internship only had 5 slots. Those 5 slots went to underprivileged people. I am not one of those people. I will have to work hard and study harder to make myself the ideal candidate.
     <p>
 <h3>August 5th, 2020. Day 141.<h3>
   <p>My girlfriend got like a panini press or sandwhich thing and I'm pretty excited to try it out. I like bread and meat, leave out the tomato and lettuce please. I emailed my instructors this morning and asked what the books I need are. Class doesn't start until the 20th of August but if I can get the books this week or next and start reading I can get a leg up on the competition. I got the Kali Linux and Ubuntu isos and put them on flash drives using rufus. I don't think I'm gonna install Kali for a while. My intention is to learn linux right now not penetration.
     <p>
 <h3>August 6th, 2020. Day 142.<h3>
    <p>I woke up and got socially distanced breakfast with my father. Then I got back home and loaded up Ubuntu. Turns out my laptop uses Intel RST so I had to restart. Great, thats 45 minutes wasted loading all the files for nothing. OK, no big deal, I'll go into BIOS and turn off RST right? WRONG. I already have windows installed using RST so if I turn off RST then windows will become unbootable and potentially have data loss. Well ok, then I need to get windows to stop using RST, and use AHCI instead, easy right? WRONG have fun editing your registry specifically change the value to 0 for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\storahci\ and for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\iaStorV\ then go into your BIOS and change from RST to AHCI then try to boot windows and pray you didn't just brick it. And no of course I didn't back up my data, I live on the wild side. Now stick your ubunto iso flash drive back into your pc and boot to it and wait another 45 minutes while it loads all the files and checks all the disks. Ok all done? I gave it a 26.6gb partition. Tell it where you are in the world (for clock settings), give it a name (SW-PREDATOR) and make a username and password! Meanwhile pray that you didn't just somehow accidentally install the OS on your windows partition. Then your computer will restart and tell you to take out your flash drive. Now it shows a menu of the different things you can boot to, ubuntu will be there and so will windows boot manager. Go check if your windows still works, it does? Great. Now boot ubuntu and see all the different things FAIL and throw all kinds of errors with invalid checksums! Now you get to research a bunch of error codes and try to live boot into a different ubuntu so you can use linux commands to look at the superblocks of the installed ubuntu! Now give up and just try reinstalling, this time don't let it connect to wifi during the OS install, and now you get to pray that the iso you got at the very beginning is actually intact and not missing a tiny thing somewhere, this is why you should have used a torrent or actually checked the SHA1! Holy moly it worked! Nice, I'm pretty sure it's the wifi, it was trying to download updates and crap and messed up. Anyways now you are in ubuntu and your laptop needs charging because it's been so many hours. At this point you can connect to wifi. Now it should splash screen a window called software, go install all the crap you need like powershell, and realize how much bloatware crap is in a install of ubuntu.
    </p>
    <p>Ok then I got a virtualbox ova for Kali and put it on my ubuntu install. Then I connected via vpn to HTB's lab environment and ran nmap on a box called Blunder. I found that port 80 was open and running an apache server. Remember how I gave it 26.6 gigs? Well that was calculated for ubuntu. NOT for ubuntu and a Kali OS inside it, in the future I should have done at least another 10.6gb.
   </p>
<h3>August 7th, 2020. Day 143.<h3>
  <p>In the morning I did some SSH stuff on overthewire. Basically I just SSHd into different places with the goal of finding a "flag" or file that has the user credentials for the next level. Basically just ls while in root and look around the directory, and then cat the files you find. Me, my mom, and Edgar washed 4 cars today at 1pm. It took 2 hours! Then at 3 ish I talked to my girlfriend on the phone then we played dnd starting at 5pm. I am really getting my days of the week messed up. I thought today was Saturday while I was playing my FRIDAY night dnd game! So I was thinking about how church is tomorrow and how certain stores will be closed for Sunday.
  </p>
<h3>August 8th, 2020. Day 144.<h3>  
  <p>I made an espresso in the morning and had some instant noodles. I did some overthewire stuff and did piping, grep, base64, rot13 (which i couldn't find a command for so I piped it into a tr) sort, and uniq. I did some calligraphy too. My last textbook came so I have them all now! I also had a ham sandwich. There isn't much to write because I basically just studied all day with breaks intermittently to eat or watch a youtube video.
  </p>
<h3>August 9th, 2020. Day 145.<h3>  
  <p>7:30am, espresso and terminal. Today I am doing xxd, mkdir, cp, gzip (zcat), bzip (bzcat) and other compression on a hexdump. I got pretty far (I think?) in the problem and then accidentally somehow deleted the temp folder that I had my file in and was working on. I got frustrated and then it was time for church. Then I went for a 2.4 mile walk while chatting with my girlfriend on the phone. I also played pokemon GO and got some pokemon. Then I got back and ate some dessert and then worked on Linux terminal some more. Ok I got it, I converted the hex dump to binary and changed the file extension from .txt to .bin, it was gzip>bzip2>gzip>tar>tar>bzip2>tar>gzip compressed.
  </p>
<h3>August 10th, 2020. Day 146.<h3>      
  <p>Woke up and had my coffee. Played some chess then did some telnet and openssl s_client stuff on linux. I also put the drawers back into that cabinet I was working on and I think it's all set now. I broke down a bunch of boxes to recycle and organized some stuff in the garage. Today is garbage night so I will take care of that. Then at 4:30pm I am going to play Gloomhaven with my friends. We only have like 2 or 3 more scenarios before we complete the game! Then I spoke to my girlfriend on the phone while she drove home from work :) 
  </p>
<h3>August 11th, 2020. Day 147.<h3>
  <p>I worked on some aggresive (-A) nmap to find open ports using SSL so that I could connect. Then some more port stuff. I walked a mile and played pokemon GO. I spoke to my friend for about an hour then played dnd with my girlfriend. The party is in a school academy that is abandoned. However all the automated testing still works so we have to take exams that are graded lol.
  </p>
<h3>August 12th, 2020. Day 148.<h3>
  <p>Today I worked on ssh'ing with a RSA private key and then also using commands in the same command as the ssh. I played some chess then my mom got our home depot order, a door sweep and led light bulbs. The bulb in the laundry area went out so I will replace that and also I will install a door sweep on one of the doors because there is a gap. I also ordered a hacksaw from amazon so that I can cut the door sweep to the correct size. I installed the light bulb easily and now am waiting for my hacksaw. I went for a walk to train and catch pokemon. I only walked 1.5 miles though, it felt like much more! I will try to walk more in the future! Then my friend called and I talked to him about cyber security stuff. Then I played some video games, I haven't played video games in a while because I've been studying. Class starts on Saturday. I don't think video games are a good use of time but I also think humans have to have some way to unwind. Then I went back to studying. This time I used netcat (nc) to listen on a port (31337 for obvious reasons) while I then sent information to that port from another terminal (I used tmux to make a split pane terminal so I could see both). I changed a lightbulb then went to bed.
  </p>
<h3>August 13th, 2020. Day 149.<h3> 
  <p>This morning I drank coffee and did some stuff with cron files. First was just looking at the tmp file that it would send data to. Second was looking at a cron shell script to see what it did, then instead of running it executing it line by line with modifications to gain access to a different tmp file. Later my mom and I took two cars to get smog checked for registration, but one didn't pass so now we need to bring it to a mechanic, what a pain. Then my hacksaw arrived! I cut the aluminum door sweep and used scissors to cut the rubber part. Then I screwed it into the door after marking and drilling pilot holes. Later my neighbor called me, he wants to put in a new fence gate for his backyard. He needs a big drill for his drill bit but I only have normal sized drills. Then I ate instant noodles and drank leftover morning coffee.
  </p>
<h3>August 14th, 2020. Day 150.<h3> 
  <p>Day 150... Wow. The coffee this morning was very good. We opened a fresh can of cafe du monde. The first few cups from a fresh can are always better than the last few cups. Then I started working on some more terminal stuff but then right as I got in the flow and was writing a shell script the power died! It was scary, pg&e said it wouldn't come back for like 3 hours! I am trying to study here! Finally it went back on about 35 minutes later and I got back to work. I kept having trouble with my shell script and it turns out I forgot a / sigh. Anyways basically on a server they have cron set up to run scripts from a specific directory. So I wrote my own shell script in a /tmp/ folder in vim then copied it to that directory so that cron would run it. The shell script would fetch the password for the next level. Then I went back to my /tmp/ folder and rm all the files and then rmdir my folder. I spoke to my friend who is also taking cyber security classes for a bit. Classes start on Monday! Then I played a level 20 dnd game with my girlfriend and Friday group.
  </p>
<h3>August 15th, 2020. Day 151.<h3>
  <p>Espresso with oat milk in the morning. It is hot again today. I woke up pretty early and started studying. I had to google a lot for this most recent problem of brute forcing a port. It wasn't that I couldn't write the thing in python, it was more that I didn't know how to use import socket. I have never used that before. Then I made some instant noodles and watched some Asmongold videos lol. Wow it is warm, it's bothering me and making it hard to study. Wow level 26 and 27 were freaking hard. I had to google it, there is no way I would have known to do that with the window size for 'more' and there is no way I would know to try and create a bash shell from inside vim. What the actual heck man. That must be some CTF crap I bet no one does this 'more' crap in real life. Then I tried to take a nap thinking that then I could just fast forward time to when it cools off in the evening but I couldn;t sleep. I grabbed a can of spindrift and commiserated with my girlfriend on the phone about how hot it was. She has a midterm right now in one of her classes and it's difficult. 
  </p>
<h3>August 16th, 2020. Day 152.<h3>
  <p>I woke up to flashes of light that turned out to be lightning at about 3:30am. I sat by my window trying to figure out what it was. Then a downpour started and cold rain hit me and felt really good. But I shut my window because water would damage all my papers and stuff. So then I googled how much energy it would consume to run my ceiling fan all night (pg&e said to use ceiling fans) and it is very cheap so I did it with no guilt and went back to sleep. It is hot. I woke up and had espresso but I think maybe I need another cup. Church with my girlfriend virtually. One of the pastors broke his pinky toe! Later I am going to go to wildseed with my sister and friend. Due to severe social distancing it will be more like we all order ahead from the same restaurant lol. I got vegan spicy sausage pizza, it was good, it had cashew mozzarella. Then I played a game (it costs 4.99) called among us with some internet friends. It is a game of secret identity like mafia and avalon. It was fun!
  </p>
<h3>August 17th, 2020. Day 153.<h3>
  <p>Morning coffee, then I played some games then did some studying. Today was about using the git command in terminal to clone a repo on a remote server, then looking at the repo. It was not difficult but I think that's because the next exercise is also git but will be more difficult. Then I realized one of my classes activated! So I spent about 3.5 hours doing a bunch of assignments and stuff. It was all pretty easy because of the self studying I had been doing. I ate instant noodles. My girlfriend and I are planning to study together over zoom!
  </p>
<h3>August 18th, 2020. Day 154.<h3>
  <p>Today is my birthday and I get to spend it in quarantine. I am ok with this. I understand that other people maybe wouldn't be though. I made espresso and ate instant noodles and then I brought the garbage cans back in from the sidewalk. The whole neighborhood still has their cans out and it is the afternoon! I got sent money from various relatives and friends for my birthday. I am going to use this money to build a network lab in my home. Basically what I need is a computer with lots of ram. That being said, there are server blades I could get but most of them have been stripped of their xeon procs, ram, and hdds. It means I would basically have to build my own anyways. I already have two pcs literally just sitting in my room unused. I intend to use them to begin my lab. I will need to buy some stuff to get them running (think of them like project cars that have been sitting around forever). Then I will put virtual machines on them and download vulnerable images and put them on and work on them. If I could get a hypervisor up and an active directory setup that would be sick.
