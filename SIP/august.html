 <h3>August 1st, 2020. Day 137.<h3>  
    <p>I ran errands in the morning again. My father picked up that car from the shop. It looks really nice, new headlights, new paint, new door, lots of little things fixed. My cousin owned the car before and she pissed some guy off in a parking lot so he keyed the car and kicked dents into it lol. I made an espresso for myself. My girlfriend is preparing a two-shot dnd game where we are all going to have max level characters so I need to flesh out my character today. I think I am going to basically make a ninja from naruto and run around doing jutsus. Now the question is which village should I be from and what chakra nature?

 <h3>August 2nd, 2020. Day 138.<h3> 
    <p>Church with my girlfriend and coffee. Later I gathered up all the garbage, recycling and compost and watered the plants. I went to lunch with my father. I played GTA Online then I headed to my girlfriends place. We got bubble tea, I got lychee jelly, that's my favorite. Then we watched an episode of Brooklyn 99.

 <h3>August 3rd, 2020. Day 139.<h3> 
 <p>SBUX drivethrough with my girlfriend. I spent the morning installing BIND on my windows laptop. You can download 32 bit or 64 bit from ISC. It will be a zip. Unzip it and run the BINDInstall.exe, you need to run it as administrator. Enter a username and a password. Leave the checkboxes alone. After this you will need to go into control panel>system>advanced>system properties>path>edit> and add your installation folder ISC BIND9/bin as a path. Then open command prompt and you can type dig and it should work. Welcome to the groper.

 <h3>August 4th, 2020. Day 140.<h3>
   <p>Today I drove my girlfriend to her office (where there are no other people because everyone works from home, but she gets more work done in the office environment) and I picked her up afterwords. I brought her favorite sushi rolls and then we played dnd. I also had a 94 minute long zoom meeting at noon with the person in charge of the internship I am trying to get at CCSF. It must have gone well because no one has a bad meeting for 94 minutes right? Anyways he said I need to learn to hack so I can do penetration testing. So I need to learn linux and powershell like ASAP. Last semester there were 30 candidates (people who got through all the classes and passed) for the internship. The internship only had 5 slots. Those 5 slots went to underprivileged people. I am not one of those people. I will have to work hard and study harder to make myself the ideal candidate.

 <h3>August 5th, 2020. Day 141.<h3>
   <p>My girlfriend got like a panini press or sandwhich thing and I'm pretty excited to try it out. I like bread and meat, leave out the tomato and lettuce please. I emailed my instructors this morning and asked what the books I need are. Class doesn't start until the 20th of August but if I can get the books this week or next and start reading I can get a leg up on the competition. I got the Kali Linux and Ubuntu isos and put them on flash drives using rufus. I don't think I'm gonna install Kali for a while. My intention is to learn linux right now not penetration.

 <h3>August 6th, 2020. Day 142.<h3>
    <p>I woke up and got socially distanced breakfast with my father. Then I got back home and loaded up Ubuntu. Turns out my laptop uses Intel RST so I had to restart. Great, thats 45 minutes wasted loading all the files for nothing. OK, no big deal, I'll go into BIOS and turn off RST right? WRONG. I already have windows installed using RST so if I turn off RST then windows will become unbootable and potentially have data loss. Well ok, then I need to get windows to stop using RST, and use AHCI instead, easy right? WRONG have fun editing your registry specifically change the value to 0 for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\storahci\ and for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\iaStorV\ then go into your BIOS and change from RST to AHCI then try to boot windows and pray you didn't just brick it. And no of course I didn't back up my data, I live on the wild side. Now stick your ubunto iso flash drive back into your pc and boot to it and wait another 45 minutes while it loads all the files and checks all the disks. Ok all done? I gave it a 26.6gb partition. Tell it where you are in the world (for clock settings), give it a name (SW-LAPTOP-PREDATOR) and make a username and password! Meanwhile pray that you didn't just somehow accidentally install the OS on your windows partition. Then your computer will restart and tell you to take out your flash drive. Now it shows a menu of the different things you can boot to, ubuntu will be there and so will windows boot manager. Go check if your windows still works, it does? Great. Now boot ubuntu and see all the different things FAIL and throw all kinds of errors with invalid checksums! Now you get to research a bunch of error codes and try to live boot into a different ubuntu so you can use linux commands to look a the superblocks of the installed ubuntu! Now give up and just try reinstalling, this time don't let it connect to wifi during the OS install, and now you get to pray that the iso you got at the very beginning is actually intact and not missing a tiny thing somewhere, this is why you should have used a torrent or actually checked the SHA1! Holy moly it worked! Nice, I'm pretty sure it's the wifi, it was trying to download updates and crap and messed up. Anyways now you are in ubuntu and your laptop needs charging because it's been so many hours. At this point you can connect to wifi. Now it should splash screen a window called software, go install all the crap you need like powershell.
    </p>
    <p>Ok then I got a virtualbox ova for Kali and put it on my ubuntu install. Then I connected via vpn to HTB's lab environment and ran nmap on a box called Blunder. I found that port 80 was open and running an apache server.
