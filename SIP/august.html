 <h3>August 1st, 2020. Day 137.<h3>  
    <p>I ran errands in the morning again. My father picked up that car from the shop. It looks really nice, new headlights, new paint, new door, lots of little things fixed. My cousin owned the car before and she pissed some guy off in a parking lot so he keyed the car and kicked dents into it lol. I made an espresso for myself. My girlfriend is preparing a two-shot dnd game where we are all going to have max level characters so I need to flesh out my character today. I think I am going to basically make a ninja from naruto and run around doing jutsus. Now the question is which village should I be from and what chakra nature?

 <h3>August 2nd, 2020. Day 138.<h3> 
    <p>Church with my girlfriend and coffee. Later I gathered up all the garbage, recycling and compost and watered the plants. I went to lunch with my father. I played GTA Online then I headed to my girlfriends place. We got bubble tea, I got lychee jelly, that's my favorite. Then we watched an episode of Brooklyn 99.

 <h3>August 3rd, 2020. Day 139.<h3> 
 <p>SBUX drivethrough with my girlfriend. I spent the morning installing BIND on my windows laptop. You can download 32 bit or 64 bit from ISC. It will be a zip. Unzip it and run the BINDInstall.exe, you need to run it as administrator. Enter a username and a password. Leave the checkboxes alone. After this you will need to go into control panel>system>advanced>system properties>path>edit> and add your installation folder ISC BIND9/bin as a path. Then open command prompt and you can type dig and it should work. Welcome to the groper.

 <h3>August 4th, 2020. Day 140.<h3>
   <p>Today I drove my girlfriend to her office (where there are no other people because everyone works from home, but she gets more work done in the office environment) and I picked her up afterwords. I brought her favorite sushi rolls and then we played dnd. I also had a 94 minute long zoom meeting at noon with the person in charge of the internship I am trying to get at CCSF. It must have gone well because no one has a bad meeting for 94 minutes right? Anyways he said I need to learn to hack so I can do penetration testing. So I need to learn linux and powershell like ASAP. Last semester there were 30 candidates (people who got through all the classes and passed) for the internship. The internship only had 5 slots. Those 5 slots went to underprivileged people. I am not one of those people. I will have to work hard and study harder to make myself the ideal candidate.

 <h3>August 5th, 2020. Day 141.<h3>
   <p>My girlfriend got like a panini press or sandwhich thing and I'm pretty excited to try it out. I like bread and meat, leave out the tomato and lettuce please. I emailed my instructors this morning and asked what the books I need are. Class doesn't start until the 20th of August but if I can get the books this week or next and start reading I can get a leg up on the competition.
