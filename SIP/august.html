 <h3>August 1st, 2020. Day 137.<h3>  
    <p>I ran errands in the morning again. My father picked up that car from the shop. It looks really nice, new headlights, new paint, new door, lots of little things fixed. My cousin owned the car before and she pissed some guy off in a parking lot so he keyed the car and kicked dents into it lol. I made an espresso for myself. My girlfriend is preparing a two-shot dnd game where we are all going to have max level characters so I need to flesh out my character today. I think I am going to basically make a ninja from naruto and run around doing jutsus. Now the question is which village should I be from and what chakra nature?

    <p>Church with my girlfriend and coffee. Later I gathered up all the garbage, recycling and compost and watered the plants. I went to lunch with my father. I played GTA Online then I headed to my girlfriends place. We got bubble tea, I got lychee jelly, that's my favorite. Then we watched an episode of Brooklyn 99.

 <h3>August 3rd, 2020. Day 139.<h3> 
 <p>SBUX drivethrough with my girlfriend. I spent the morning installing BIND on my windows laptop. You can download 32 bit or 64 bit from ISC. It will be a zip. Unzip it and run the BINDInstall.exe, you need to run it as administrator. Enter a username and a password. Leave the checkboxes alone. After this you will need to go into control panel>system>advanced>system properties>path>edit> and add your installation folder ISC BIND9/bin as a path. Then open command prompt and you can type dig and it should work. Welcome to the groper.
