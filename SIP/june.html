        <h3>June 22nd, 2020. Day 97.</h3>
        <p>Ok well the notes function has like completely broken. Maybe its because I got close to 100 (I think I had 96 notes and 4 drafts). Regardless, I have disliked facebook's UI for years now. I had written a lot for yesterday's note. I'm sure it's still there somewhere but I don't have access to it. So I guess this is day 97's note. This is frustrating to the point that I think I will begin making the notes in a google doc and I will put the link in here.
        </p>

EDIT 1: I remember I posted about a job update so I will try to retype it. The mayor said she was gonna try to make it so I could work on July 13. San Francisco is one of 4 counties in California that have NOT gotten a regional variance for the SIP. This basically means we can't move to phase 3 or even really phase 2.5. So the Mayor yesterday said she was gonna try some other stuff so that I could work by June 29. No guarantee though. The other 3 counties are Imperial, Alameda, and Santa Clara.

        <h3>June 23rd, 2020. Day 98.</h3>
        <p>Coffee, chess. Today is the day after garbage day so all my cans were empty, this allowed me to sweep the driveway and put all the leaves in there. Then I also cut up a bunch of cardboard boxes from packaging and Amazon and put those in the recycle bin. I made sure to leave some room for whatever recycle we generate this week. I watered the plants. My best friend video called me with his family and we talked. They were using those like 10 pronged head massager things the entire call. I am going to begin putting my notes here instead of on Facebook because I can't seem to be able to access my facebook notes anymore.</p>
        <p>I normally play dnd with my girlfriend and Tuesday group on Tuesdays. Today is Tuesday. There was a message several days ago saying we were going to postpone this week. I read it and confirmed it. Then today I thought we were playing! I the shelter in place hits me in like waves, think of a sin wave. It makes me super motivated sometimes and I get a bunch of stuff done and I say 'I'm going to come out of the SIP a better person than I entered!' but then other days it has these valleys, where I can barely remember what I did even a hour prior, let alone the previous day. I think I just hit one of those slumps. I will try very hard to climb out fast tomorrow. Maybe if I can figure out a way to climb out faster then I can spend more time above '0'.</p>

        <h3>June 24th, 2020. Day 99.</h3>
        <p>Coffee, chess, strawberries, blackberries, pasta. I did a Barbicide COVID-19 safety certfication and got all the questions correct. My salon is scheduling a staff meeting for July 10th and we are going to go over all the changes we are making and disinfect the salon and stuff. Then I got a call from my sister asking for help with their new dog. They went to the SPCA today and adopted a dog and she had a bunch of possessions that they needed a car for so I went and picked them up. They got the new dog set up in their apartment and set up a bed for her and stuff. I spent the rest of the day hanging out with darwin and chilling on my computer. Darwin was doing this weird thing where his left eye wasn't opening all the way. I kept checking on him and there was no change, but then in the evening it's fine. Maybe he was just tired so he was only opening one eye.
        </p>
        
        <h3>June 25th, 2020. Day 100.</h3>
        <p>Day 100! We made it! Maybe we can make it to 365! That was sarcasm. My left eye started twitching yesterday and is still twitching today. What this usually means is that I'm stressed out. Whenever I get super stressed I don't feel it at all and instead I start getting physical symptoms. One of my eyes will usually twitch and I will get frequent nightmares if it continues. I often don't know what I'm stressed about and usually take several days to weeks to even figure it out. But in the meantime I feel fine. I started that coursera class again, this time as a audit. Last time was as a 7 day free trial. The audit is free but I can't turn in any assignments or take any of the exams. But! I can still take the class. So my plan is to take the class as a audit, then when it's time to turn in an assignment I will sign up. This should give me like 2-3 days of audit where I won't have to pay anything. I was also thinking maybe I should make like 10 minute youtube videos about the subject because I already take notes as a powerpoint presentation anyways so I could just present it and record it.</p>
        <p>My girlfriend gave me call today while at work! It was nice to talk to her. I called my grandma and she didn't answer so I called her again. She didn't answer this time either so I'm going to call her again tomorrow. Well she called back and everything is fine, she just never heard my calls for some reason.</p>
        <p>I got to spend time with my girlfriend! I got us each a order of her favorite bulgogi from this mom and pop korean restaurant down the street. Then we watched a show together, it was very enjoyable :)</p>
        
        <h3>June 26th, 2020. Day 101.</h3>
        <p> I have 10 bags of soil in the backyard that I brought in from the car yesterday. My mom went to Home Depot and picked it up after ordering online. Today I intend to mix it all and put it in these brick planters we have. I also intend to work on that coursera course. Then I have dnd tonight with my friday group. I ate some leftover bulgogi from last night, it was yummy.</p>
        <p>I unloaded all the soil and we planted wildflower seeds and wet the soil and covered it so it could germinate with no wind to ruin everything. Then I played dnd with my girlfriend and friday group. We explored a cave and fought a minotaur. Then we found this weird block with a puzzle on it. We solved it and opened a rift to the elemental plane of air.
        </p>
        <h3>June 27th, 2020. Day 102.</h3>
        <p>Today is Saturday. My mom took darwin to the vet and it turns out he has hip displacia which explains why he favors a certain way of sitting and walks much slower now. We also need to keep him warm because his body temperature is a little low. I have a space heater that I can point at him. I played chess and watched youtube videos. Then I played dnd with some friends using Foundry. Darwin also got to meet my sister's dog today at a dog park and they became friends! In the dnd game we all almost died and one of us actually did, the final battle was crazy and had 3 parts.
        </p>
        <h3>June 28th, 2020. Day 103.</h3>
        <p>Church! My church has become a hub for food and supplies like diapers, apparently it doesn't really have room for people to actually do stuff anymore. We still aren't going to service and instead watching uploaded videos that they make during each week. Yesterday I did laundry and I did some more today. I played some fire emblem on a switch I borrowed from a friend. I played some chess and drank espresso. I also got two cheeseburgers from my neighbors. I did a bunch of other chores today like taking out the garbage and recycle, the dishes, and breaking down a bunch more amazon boxes. Oh also the freaking hot water went out while I was in the shower yesterday! I hate that!
        </p>
        <h3>June 29th - July 1st, 2020. Day 104, 105, 106.</h3>
        <p>Coffee. Chess. I worked on that coursera course basically all day during these days. Ok wow at about 3:30pm on July 1st I had a bad time. I ended up in the bathroom with cramps for about 3.5 hours. I don't really want to talk about it here, it was really nasty. In fact, I'm writing this several days later because of all the crap that happened since.
