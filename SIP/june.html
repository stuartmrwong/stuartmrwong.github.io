        <p>Coffee, chess. Today is the day after garbage day so all my cans were empty, this allowed me to sweep the driveway and put all the leaves in there. Then I also cut up a bunch of cardboard boxes from packaging and Amazon and put those in the recycle bin. I made sure to leave some room for whatever recycle we generate this week. I watered the plants. My best friend video called me with his family and we talked. They were using those like 10 pronged head massager things the entire call. I am going to begin putting my notes here instead of on Facebook because I can't seem to be able to access my facebook notes anymore.</p>
