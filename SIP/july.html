<h3>July 2nd, 2020. Day 107.</h3>
        <p>Thursday. Still recovering from yesterday. My girlfriend got me gatorade, chicken noodle soup, and saltine crackers with low salt. It really helped. I really appreciate her. Sorry for the dead words.
        </p>
<h3>July 3rd, 2020. Day 108.</h3>   
        <p> Darwin the dog passed away this morning in his sleep. I walked 4 miles with my girlfriend to try and process it. My mother and I took his rigor mortised body to my sister so she could say goodbye. Then to the vet so they can cremate him. 2020 has not been pretty rough.
        </p>
<h3>July 4th, 2020. Day 109.</h3>   
        <p>Happy Independance day! I feel a little weird, I think I'm in denial. Lots of fireworks tonight. I could see them above this hill near my house. Lots of car alarms too.
        </p>
<h3>July 5th, 2020. Day 110.</h3>   
        <p>This morning I went to grab oat milk for my coffee and I grabbed orange juice! I poured some into my mug, luckily there wasn't any coffee in it yet. I colored my mom's hair in the bathroom. I played chess and some other games, and I watched youtube videos. I made a instant udon noodle bowl and ate hawaiian chips. My friend said he is going to deliver something to me and leave it on my doorstep and that it's a surprise, I wonder what it is.
        </p>   
<h3>July 6th, 2020. Day 111.</h3> 
        <p>My girlfriend's neighbor had a emergency so I went over there. Everything was fine later. I started playing this game on my phone called Mindustry, it's like factorio. The game is ok but all it really does is just make me want to play factorio lol. I also watched like 4 episodes of 'The Babysitters Club' with my girlfriend. It's a show for like 13 year old girls but it has solid writing because it's based on a book series from the late 80s. Netflix funded it I think and it has pretty good production value which is basically all I care about. The mom is played by the lady from Clueless! So that's cool. Clueless and Mean Girls are classics.
        </p>
<h3>July 7th, 2020. Day 112.</h3>    
        <p>Today I check on a order for my grandma. I think I forgot to mention that I ordered her a blender. It will arrive tomorrow. I called her the other day and she was like 'I want a blender!' So I was like ok sure and I ordered one that looked simple (5 buttons) from amazon. It's that ninja one. I ate some instant noodles and played some chess. For the past several days (since the death of Darwin) my focus has been very bad. I function completely fine, driving is fine etc. However my short term memory seems worse by about 1 standard deviation, enough to be statistically significant. I also seem incapable of extrapolating pertinent information, for example, I made 2 plans for the same evening, a dinner and also a video game session. I should have known that something was happening that night but didn't. On a side note, we are moving our Tuesday dnd game to Saturdays now to better accomodate one the player's work schedules.
        </p>
<h3>July 8th, 2020. Day 113.</h3> 
        <p>My coginitive function still seems impaired. I made some chess blunders and could tell my focus was off. Like I would calculate a trade, think it was sound, do the trade, and be down a pawn. Later I got the blender delivered, I took it out of the box and tested it, then drove it over to my grandma and told her how to use it (with my voice while being 6 feet away, outdoors, with masks). Then later I played Gloomhaven with my friends! There are 3 missions left and then after that we get to fight the 'void' which is like the big bad boss at the very end. Each of these missions is kind of a 2 parter so we did part 1 of mission 1 today.
        </p>
<h3>July 9th, 2020. Day 114.</h3> 
        <p> I won some chess games today so my cognition is coming back I think. Although actually I drew a game that I really should have won so maybe not. And then another game I lost on time when I couldn't mate with a rook, king and knight. I did some gardening today with my mom and I was moody the whole time. Normally it's just watering or planting so it's pretty easy but today she wanted to weed this area that I don't see the point in weeding. So here's how I think of it: the weeds are currently at 100%, they can't get any worse. We are going to weed it but then not plant anything there and the weeds are just going to come back. We never planted anything there so the weeds aren't bothering anything either. Today I weeded and got it down to probably 40% or less. But now it's just gonna come back. Well whatever.
        </p>
        <p>It was my intention to code some stuff in C today but after running errands and then shoveling in the yard I am tired. Maybe that's just a bad excuse. And tomorrow I have errands in the morning, then a salon meeting, then my friday dungeons and dragons group so idk if I will get any done tomorrow either. And then Saturday I have plans and Sunday too. You wouldn't believe how busy I am while sheltering in place and being jobless. It's crazy how quickly you can fill up your days with stuff.
        </p>
<h3>July 10th, 2020. Day 115.</h3>
        <p>I ran an errand in the morning. The salon meeting was cancelled, we have a special cleaning happening and apparently it won't be finished yet so we can't go in. I have dnd tonight with my friday group. I have been playing Fire Emblem: Three Houses (fe3h) on the switch I borrowed from my friend. It is a fun game and reminds me of Lanchester's Linear and Square Laws. You have to use both because I have troops that are melee (linear) and troops that are ranged (square). The one problem is that Lanchester's Laws are mainly used for equally skilled troops on both sides, but in fe3h you are the hero and you fight trash so often times you completely overwhelm them. Still interesting to think about though.
        </p>
        <p>Dnd, we went to the elemental plane of air and found some kenku and aaracokra that got their city taken by djinn. Our plan to liberate the city is to hold a dinner party for djinn and then steal a bunch of stuff from their house while they are at our dinner. Our plans usually end up very weird like this lol.</p>
<h3>July 11th, 2020. Day 116.</h3>        
        <p>Today I did laundry and I'm going to go for a long walk with my gf outside with masks. Then there is dnd tonight because remember the tuesday game got moved to saturday. So I play dnd twice a week, Friday and Saturday. The Friday game is usually about 3.5-4 hours and the Saturday game is usually about 2 hours.
        </p>
        <p>So imagine you work for a tech startup. There is a internal tool you use and one day it breaks. Ok no problem, the team in charge of that tool will fix it. But then they say oh sorry it won't be fixed for about 3 weeks. You think 'Wow that's kind of a long time' you literally cannot work until this is ready. Well 3 weeks go by and they say oh sorry we need another 11 days. 'Ok' you think. Then a couple days go by and without you even asking they say oh extend that to 15 days. Then the week of they say oh we will let you know the status by the end of the week, now they aren't even giving you a deadline. Then the end of the week comes and they say the fix is 'on hold' and won't tell you anything more. That's the current status of salons reopening in San Francisco. The first date was June 29th, then July 9, then July 13. 'The end of the week' was yesterday. Current status: <a href="https://sf.gov/step-by-step/reopening-san-francisco"> 'on hold'</a>.
        </p>
        <p>I managed to get some C stuff done. I got MinGW onto my laptop and edited the environment variable for PATH, this way I can actually run gcc and compile stuff. Next I put notepad++ on there because I'm familiar with it, not because it's the best. I wrote an simple printf program and converted it to a executable using the command line. At this point windows literally just deleted it because they said it was a virus. Windows also refused to run my .exe. So I went into the security settings and told Windows to stop controlling my life! Then I made the executable again and ran it and saw my printf so I know it works. We had decided to rain check dnd tonight. 2 players weren't feeling up to it. That's fine though, I went for a long walk with my girlfriend and talked with her for a long time :) 
        </p>
<h3>July 12th, 2020. Day 117.</h3>  
        <p>Ok so think of graph theory real quick. My mother and I share a node. Nodes are households. This graph is undirected. There is a edge that connect my node to my sister and her boyfriend's node. Then there is a node that connects my node to my girlfriends node. That is basically our shelter in place bubble as the media likes to call it. It really should be called an undirected graph though because 'bubble' has a subjective meaning. Anyways, I am only stating that so that you can understand how my personal bubble works, and why I hang out with my girlfriend and sister sometimes. Today I have church (remotely) with my girlfriend at 10am, then I will take out the garbage and do the dishes. After that I will drive to pickup my sister, her boyfriend and their dog. I am going to drive her boyfriend to the airport later. Then I was going to go my girlfriends place but we rescheduled until tomorrow. I played mahjong with my family and I didn't win a single hand. I only lost twice though so at least that's something lol.
        </p>
<h3>July 13th, 2020. Day 118.</h3>  
        <p>This morning I cut my sister's hair at our home. Then she walked her dog and I played chess and watched youtube videos. I'm going to go to my girlfriend's at 3pm. I should think of some kind of plan for dinner. I was considering getting her favorite sushi and bringing it with me, but the problem with that is that I will get there at 3pm and she doesn't get off work until 5pm, so the sushi would be kind of not optimal. So maybe I get there at 3pm then go out and get something at around 4:45 or something like that. I played some more mahjong and actually won a couple games but still ended up losing overall.
        </p>
        <p>I went to my girlfriend's place and we baked ziti and garlic bread together for dinner then watched a couple episodes of brooklyn 99. Then went for a walk, it was very nice, we talked about important stuff.
        </p>
<h3>July 14th, 2020. Day 119.<h3>
        <p>I worked on C programming today. If you want to see it you can let me know and I will show you my private github repo with the programs I've written. It is private because the programs are very simple and aren't really worth showing people. I watched a bunch of 'drunk history' on comedy central with my girlfriend.
  </p>
<h3>July 15th, 2020. Day 120.<h3>
        <p>I played some chess in the morning and went for a walk with my girlfriend. Then I went home and played mahjong with my sister and mom. Darwin's ashes are ready today but we are going to pick them up tomorrow. The power went out at aroudn 7pm! Everything got so quiet and all the neighbors texted each other, everyone was in a frenzy. My mom even took a rushed shower thinking there would be no light very soon. Then the power came back on 18 minutes later. Everything is back to normal now, whew I was scared there.
  </p>
<h3>July 16th, 2020. Day 121.<h3>
        <p>Today my mom picked up Darwin's ashes. He is in a little wood box with room for a photo on the front so we are gonna pick a photo out. I also got a email from one of my school instructors for fall. Classes don't start until November but he wanted to email the students now and make sure we were aware that all classes will be online and also that his class is not for beginners. I don't really think I am a beginner but maybe I am so I emailed him and told him the classes I am taking in the fall and asked if I should swap some or drop some. We got pizza from Blaze and it was yummy. It kind of made it feel like things are normal but they aren't. I am kind of stressed out and I don't know why. Maybe it's because the instructor will say I should drop some classes to focus? But that wouldn't be anything to worry about because I would be trading a sub optimal future for a more optimal future so that's only a good thing. Maybe it's because of Darwin's death? That is more likely it. My focus has been recovering lately though so I thought maybe I was getting through the grieving. Writing about this right now has actually really helped my stress level. Also to any future employers reading this: you should hire me. hehe. Oh he just emailed me back! He said I should just stay in the classes and I will probably be fine with my background but if I start falling behind then just drop the class before the drop date. This is kind of obvious, why didn't I think of that? I have never dropped a class though before, it feels kind of like giving up or admitting defeat? But it is a tool to be used, kind of like auditing a class. So maybe I shouldn't be so restrictive about using it.
  </p>
 <h3>July 17th, 2020. Day 122.<h3> 
        <p>Today I ate some instant noodles and strawberries. I also had two cups of coffee this morning. I played a bunch of chess and watched youtube videos and worked on that map some more. I added the rivers. I took a nap so I would have energy to stay up late for the dnd game. I also cracked open a can of coke (something I don't normally do) and sipped on it while playing. It was fun, my girlfriend ran the game and I spent most of the session trying to acquire butter for puff pastry. My character was unaware that immediately after I left to procure it, another character just conjured the butter making my entire trip to the market (and getting my wallet stolen) completely useless. Oh also I played 3 classical chess games today which took like 40 minutes each. I didn't do very well.
   </p>
 <h3>July 18th, 2020. Day 123.<h3> 
   <p>Day 123! I made coffee and ate my last maruchan cup noodle instant lunch. That's ok though. Then I talked with my girlfriend over the phone for 46 minutes, that was nice, I enjoy that. Then I watered the flowers and then laid out some more of that weed guard stuff. I laid about 15 yards I would say, maybe more. There is maybe 10 more yards that I should do but that's the hardest part, there are big plants in the way and I'm not sure how to approach it, I will probably have to get on my hands and knees (so the branches don't hit my face) and I will end up very dirty. Then I worked on that map some more, I added some place names and changed the coastline of one of the continents.
   </p>
   <p>Oh I almost forgot to mention I've been playing this game called fire emblem 3 houses on switch and it is really fun what a great game. Oh and I made sure I am up to date un my unemployment stuff and I made sure to pay for my classes in Fall 2020. It was weird though my account balance is -4.00 so I somehow have a credit? I must have overpaid last semester by the amount I should have paid this semester AND 4 dollars? That seems unlikely but ok?
   </p>
 <h3>July 19th, 2020. Day 124.<h3> 
   <p>This morning I woke up with a headache. I got some coffee but it didn't really help. Church. Then I took a shower, ate some food and drank some water. That helped. Then I watched youtube videos and went to my neighbors. He barbequed again and so he made me a plate! Of course I had a mask and observed social distancing. I also have been reading one of the textbooks for my Fall classes about DNS. I have begun making a presentation about it (basically my way of taking notes). My sister paid for the book so that was pretty cool of her. I worked on that map for my saturday night dnd game too.
   </p>
 <h3>July 20th, 2020. Day 125.<h3> 
   <p>There is talk of allowing salons to do outdoor services but it doesn't sound like it will happen. My eye is still twitching a little. I went to the doctor this morning for a biannual checkup, and everything is fine. There were lots of covid procedures set up, like when I entered the building I had to sanitize my hands, get my temperature taken, answer a ton of questions, while standing in a taped square on the ground. Then inside the office there were clear paths I could walk in. Later I went home and started up the red mercedes and backed it into the driveway so it could air out a little. Then I went to my girlfriend's place and I surprised her with her favorite cake from 85 degrees. Then in the evening we went for a 3 mile walk. We also watched some episodes of brooklyn 99.
   </p>
 <h3>July 21st, 2020. Day 126.<h3> 
   <p>I woke up at 6:30 and spent a hour laying in bed, then at 7:30 I made coffee and studied for 1 hour. at 8:30 I had finished chapter 1 of that textbook and written notes that I can present with slides and stuff. The governer said hair stylists can work outside. Then 2 hours later the department of consumer affairs released a 6 page memo saying you can't shampoo and you can't do chemical services. At first I thought this seemed fine but after about 2 minutes of thinking about it I realized how botched this is. Insurance doesn't cover any of this, and according the state board of barbering and cosmetology this isn't actually allowed. Sigh.
   </p>
 <h3>July 22nd, 2020. Day 127.<h3>
   <p>Today I woke up early. I got starbucks with my girlfriend then headed home. I called my grandma and it turns out she hasn't even touched that blender I got her! Then I went for a walk with my father who I haven't seen in a while. We stayed 6 feet apart, outside, with masks. We walked to ono hawaiian bbq where I got a meal to go and took it home. On the way home though I went to autozone and got a replacement rear reverse light. The light wasn't actually broken though, if you smacked it, it would work. But I replaced it anyways. Then at back at home I cut up a rug and tied a bunch of other rugs together so we can give them to recology for textile recycling. They are old, dirty and we don't want them. Then I got a bad headache. It got so bad I had to take ibuprofen. I studied DNS some more and played chess. I had a conversation with my mom about all the things that need repairing to get our downstairs unit ready, our neighbor is going to rent it for a little bit. We will dust it tomorrow and make sure it is presentable. Speaking of tomorrow, I need to go to my grandma's tomorrow to deliver her mail. 
     <p>
  <h3>July 23rd, 2020. Day 128.<h3>  
    <p>My plan for today is to go pickup mail then head to my grandmothers by noon and give it to her. Then I will come back to the house and clean the unit. At some point I want to record a video presentation on DNS so that I can show all of you. Ok I woke up, got my coffee, went to my grandma's with her mail. She told me about how bored she is and I went to CVS and got her some stuff. She said she was going to go and I didn't want that so I made her let me go instead of her. In the afternoon my mom and cleaned the unit a lot. I went with a stool and dusted all the high places. Then I moved all the furniture around and used a steam mop on the hardwood floor. I undid some drapes and my mom washed them. We aren't finished but we got pooped so we took a break. Then we got 8 more cubic yard of top soil and my mom can't really lift it so I had to bring it all to the backyard while my mom watered the plants. Oh I also watered the other plants earlier in the day. Now it is the evening and I ate some cheez-its and watched a chess sub battle. I wanted to do the video today but I'm going to flesh out the script more tomorrow with my friend. My sister said if I watch her dog on Saturday she will buy me lunch! What should I get?
    </p>
  <h3>July 24th, 2020. Day 129.<h3>  
    <p>So today I unloaded and leveled out all the soil in the backyard, about 24 cubic yards worth. Then my mom and I planted wildflower seeds in it. I wore the same clothes that I wore yesterday when cleaning the unit so they are my dirty clothes now and it seems like a waste to wash them if I know I'm going to need clothes that I don't mind getting dirty. But of course at some point I have to wash them. What a conundrum. Afterwards I had ice cream and fruit to reward myself. Then I presented my DNS presentation to my friend over discord for a good 2 hours. After that I played dnd with my girlfriend and friday group. We saved a city in the elemental plane of air from a mean djinn! 
    </p>
  <h3>July 25th, 2020. Day 130.<h3>
    <p>I made coffee this morning then did some more DNS stuff. My sister came over at 10:30 and dropped off her dog for me to dog sit. She got me sushi for lunch as a thank you. I walked Bailey (the dog) and played some pokemon GO. I wrote a letter but didn't finish it to my neighbors that always barbeque me food on Sunday evenings. I want to thank them and I thought a letter would be fitting. I played some chess. Rust Valley Restorers season 2 is on Neflix! I thought after the end of season 1 that he got bought out and was donezo. I played Gloomhaven with my friends in the evening, we did a scenario with a boss in it and the the beginning was really hard and we thought we would lose but we pulled through. I got my video capture software working on my laptop so I can make the DNS videos on that and even have a facecam! Because when you are trying to learn something of course you need a stupid facecam taking up 1/8th of the screen and covering up critical information. 
    </p>
    <p>Dad joke time! Where does the king keep his armies?</p>
  <h3>July 26th, 2020. Day 131.<h3>
    <p>The answer to the dad joke is "up his sleeves" hehehe. Remember how I told you a long time ago my GPU was broken? Well I replaced it with a backup I had in my closet. It's a 550 ti, that is a 9 year old card, it came out in 2011 and even then it was a budget card. No wonder my computer keep crashing and stuff. Anyways I need to get a new card. I don't have the money to get the same card as my sister, not only has it gone up in price but I haven't been working and thus can't justify buying a card that isn't budget tier. So I think I'm going to buy a 1650 super, it's a budget card. I then did a lot more work in the unit.
    </p>
 <h3>July 27th, 2020. Day 132.<h3>  
   <p>My friend has a rhodia book and he let me borrow it to practice calligraphy. This paper is great, there is no bleeding! It's the best paper I have ever put ink on. I did a bunch of calligraphy practice this morning, I wrote quotes and I wrote the first names of everyone I could think of. Then in the afternoon I cut some trim and baseboard so that a cabinet would fit. It was a lot of work that no one will ever notice probably. Like literally 1/8th of an inch cuts but it makes it so the cabinet and the trim are flush and it looks really nice and fits perfect. Then I worked on getting melted plastic off of my girlfriend's pan some more. I said screw it and just used a power sander, it came off easily but still took time and now it looks very shiny and scuffed kind of. Next is to get the burned oil off the pan. The plan is to boil water and white vinegar then add baking soda and let the fizz take care of it. 
   </p>
 <h3>July 28th, 2020. Day 133.<h3>    
   <p>Today I did more calligraphy practice and studied DNS. Then I cleaned the unit bathroom and floor. Then my mom picked up some stuff from home depot. I am super cheap and need two table legs. Well you know what's a super cheap material that I know how to work with? 59 cent bricks. So I got 14 bricks and am gluing them together with silicone construction adhesive, one tube is 2.79. This is like super cheap but that's who I am now. Then I worked on my garage project a little bit. Progress can't really continue though. Then I finished cleaning my girlfriend's pan. I had to use steel wool to get the burnt oil off. It is done now though! All clean! My GPU should arrive sometime before 9pm and I will install it and maybe record a video about resource records in DNS. I talked to my girlfriend on the phone while installing drivers. Then I tried to record the video and realized I really do need a script. I was all over the place. That video will never see the light of day.
   </p>
 <h3>July 29th, 2020. Day 134.<h3>  
   <p>Ran a errand in the morning and stopped at a bakery and got some chocolate croissants. I finished a ornate calligraphy piece for my girlfriend. Someday I'm gonna get fancy inks and the principality nib and nice paper with no gridlines and do some crazy work. I worked on my calligraphy and I messed up the last word in a quote. I didn't even mess up the word, I messed up the spacing. I refuse to present it and will redo it tomorrow, sigh. Well this is how you learn, you make mistakes. I will be more vigilant with spacing until it becomes second nature. I played Gloomhaven in the evening with my friends, we only have 3 more scenarios until the end of the game! Tonight's mission was really hard, I died before anyone else and we almost didn't complete it.
   </p>
