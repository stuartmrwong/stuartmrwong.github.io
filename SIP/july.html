<h3>July 2nd, 2020. Day 107.</h3>
        <p>Thursday. Still recovering from yesterday. My girlfriend got me gatorade, chicken noodle soup, and saltine crackers with low salt. It really helped. I really appreciate her. Sorry for the dead words.
        </p>
<h3>July 3rd, 2020. Day 108.</h3>   
        <p> Darwin the dog passed away this morning in his sleep. I walked 4 miles with my girlfriend to try and process it. My mother and I took his rigor mortised body to my sister so she could say goodbye. Then to the vet so they can cremate him. 2020 has not been pretty rough.
        </p>
<h3>July 4th, 2020. Day 109.</h3>   
        <p>Happy Independance day! I feel a little weird, I think I'm in denial. Lots of fireworks tonight. I could see them above this hill near my house. Lots of car alarms too.
        </p>
<h3>July 5th, 2020. Day 110.</h3>   
        <p>This morning I went to grab oat milk for my coffee and I grabbed orange juice! I poured some into my mug, luckily there wasn't any coffee in it yet. I colored my mom's hair in the bathroom. I played chess and some other games, and I watched youtube videos. I made a instant udon noodle bowl and ate hawaiian chips. My friend said he is going to deliver something to me and leave it on my doorstep and that it's a surprise, I wonder what it is.
        </p>   
<h3>July 6th, 2020. Day 111.</h3> 
        <p>My girlfriend's neighbor had a emergency so I went over there. Everything was fine later. I started playing this game on my phone called Mindustry, it's like factorio. The game is ok but all it really does is just make me want to play factorio lol. I also watched like 4 episodes of 'The Babysitters Club' with my girlfriend. It's a show for like 13 year old girls but it has solid writing because it's based on a book series from the late 80s. Netflix funded it I think and it has pretty good production value which is basically all I care about. The mom is played by the lady from Clueless! So that's cool. Clueless and Mean Girls are classics.
        </p>
<h3>July 7th, 2020. Day 112.</h3>    
        <p>Today I check on a order for my grandma. I think I forgot to mention that I ordered her a blender. It will arrive tomorrow. I called her the other day and she was like 'I want a blender!' So I was like ok sure and I ordered one that looked simple (5 buttons) from amazon. It's that ninja one. I ate some instant noodles and played some chess. For the past several days (since the death of Darwin) my focus has been very bad. I function completely fine, driving is fine etc. However my short term memory seems worse by about 1 standard deviation, enough to be statistically significant. I also seem incapable of extrapolating pertinent information, for example, I made 2 plans for the same evening, a dinner and also a video game session. I should have known that something was happening that night but didn't. On a side note, we are moving our Tuesday dnd game to Saturdays now to better accomodate one the player's work schedules.
        </p>
<h3>July 8th, 2020. Day 113.</h3> 
        <p>My coginitive function still seems impaired. I made some chess blunders and could tell my focus was off. Like I would calculate a trade, think it was sound, do the trade, and be down a pawn. Later I got the blender delivered, I took it out of the box and tested it, then drove it over to my grandma and told her how to use it (with my voice while being 6 feet away, outdoors, with masks). Then later I played Gloomhaven with my friends! There are 3 missions left and then after that we get to fight the 'void' which is like the big bad boss at the very end. Each of these missions is kind of a 2 parter so we did part 1 of mission 1 today.
        </p>
<h3>July 9th, 2020. Day 114.</h3> 
        <p> I won some chess games today so my cognition is coming back I think. Although actually I drew a game that I really should have won so maybe not. And then another game I lost on time when I couldn't mate with a rook, king and knight. I did some gardening today with my mom and I was moody the whole time. Normally it's just watering or planting so it's pretty easy but today she wanted to weed this area that I don't see the point in weeding. So here's how I think of it: the weeds are currently at 100%, they can't get any worse. We are going to weed it but then not plant anything there and the weeds are just going to come back. We never planted anything there so the weeds aren't bothering anything either. Today I weeded and got it down to probably 40% or less. But now it's just gonna come back. Well whatever.
        </p>
        <p>It was my intention to code some stuff in C today but after running errands and then shoveling in the yard I am tired. Maybe that's just a bad excuse. And tomorrow I have errands in the morning, then a salon meeting, then my friday dungeons and dragons group so idk if I will get any done tomorrow either. And then Saturday I have plans and Sunday too. You wouldn't believe how busy I am while sheltering in place and being jobless. It's crazy how quickly you can fill up your days with stuff.
        </p>
<h3>July 10th, 2020. Day 115.</h3>
        <p>I ran an errand in the morning. The salon meeting was cancelled, we have a special cleaning happening and apparently it won't be finished yet so we can't go in. I have dnd tonight with my friday group. I have been playing Fire Emblem: Three Houses (fe3h) on the switch I borrowed from my friend. It is a fun game and reminds me of Lanchester's Linear and Square Laws. You have to use both because I have troops that are melee (linear) and troops that are ranged (square). The one problem is that Lanchester's Laws are mainly used for equally skilled troops on both sides, but in fe3h you are the hero and you fight trash so often times you completely overwhelm them. Still interesting to think about though.
        </p>
        <p>Dnd, we went to the elemental plane of air and found some kenku and aaracokra that got their city taken by djinn. Our plan to liberate the city is to hold a dinner party for djinn and then steal a bunch of stuff from their house while they are at our dinner. Our plans usually end up very weird like this lol.</p>
<h3>July 11th, 2020. Day 116.</h3>        
        <p>Today I did laundry and I'm going to go for a long walk with my gf outside with masks. Then there is dnd tonight because remember the tuesday game got moved to saturday. So I play dnd twice a week, Friday and Saturday. The Friday game is usually about 3.5-4 hours and the Saturday game is usually about 2 hours.
        </p>
        <p>So imagine you work for a tech startup. There is a internal tool you use and one day it breaks. Ok no problem, the team in charge of that tool will fix it. But then they say oh sorry it won't be fixed for about 3 weeks. You think 'Wow that's kind of a long time' you literally cannot work until this is ready. Well 3 weeks go by and they say oh sorry we need another 11 days. 'Ok' you think. Then a couple days go by and without you even asking they say oh extend that to 15 days. Then the week of they say oh we will let you know the status by the end of the week, now they aren't even giving you a deadline. Then the end of the week comes and they say the fix is 'on hold' and won't tell you anything more. That's the current status of salons reopening in San Francisco. The first date was June 29th, then July 9, then July 13. 'The end of the week' was yesterday. Current status: <a href="https://sf.gov/step-by-step/reopening-san-francisco"> 'on hold'</a>.
