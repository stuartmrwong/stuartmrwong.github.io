<h3>July 2nd, 2020. Day 107.</h3>
        <p>Thursday. Still recovering from yesterday. My girlfriend got me gatorade, chicken noodle soup, and saltine crackers with low salt. It really helped. I really appreciate her. Sorry for the dead words.

        <p> Darwin the dog passed away this morning in his sleep. I walked 4 miles with my girlfriend to try and process it. My mother and I took his rigor mortised body to my sister so she could say goodbye. Then to the vet so they can cremate him. 2020 has not been pretty rough.

        <p>Happy Independance day! I feel a little weird, I think I'm in denial. Lots of fireworks tonight. I could see them above this hill near my house. Lots of car alarms too.

<h3>July 5th, 2020. Day 110.</h3>   
        <p>This morning I went to grab oat milk for my coffee and I grabbed orange juice! I poured some into my mug, luckily there wasn't any coffee in it yet. I colored my mom's hair in the bathroom. I played chess and some other games, and I watched youtube videos. I made a instant udon noodle bowl and ate hawaiian chips. My friend said he is going to deliver something to me and leave it on my doorstep and that it's a surprise, I wonder what it is.
