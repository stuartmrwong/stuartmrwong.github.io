<h3>July 2nd, 2020. Day 107.</h3>
        <p>Thursday. Still recovering from yesterday. My girlfriend got me gatorade, chicken noodle soup, and saltine crackers with low salt. It really helped. I really appreciate her. Sorry for the dead words.

<h3>July 3rd, 2020. Day 108.</h3>   
        <p> Darwin the dog passed away this morning in his sleep. I walked 4 miles with my girlfriend to try and process it. My mother and I took his rigor mortised body to my sister so she could say goodbye. Then to the vet so they can cremate him. 2020 has not been pretty rough.

<h3>July 4th, 2020. Day 109.</h3>   
        <p>Happy Independance day! I feel a little weird, I think I'm in denial.
